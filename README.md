## This is a command line app which takes in any one of four different commands: 
  - "spotify-this-song"
  - "movie-this"
  - "my-tweets"
  - "do-what-it-says"
  
## The requirements were to meet specs for all of the specific functions which called on different APIs including Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB, mostly by using npm packages including the Spotify, Twitter, Request and FS packages.
